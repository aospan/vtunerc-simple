* ./build.sh

note 1: uncomment lines in build.sh for ARM platform
note 2: change 
#define READ_SIZE 7*188
#define UDELAY 5
for different bitrates

### Run:
# ./vtuner-simple input.ts 
40090624 bytes written, speed = 76.47 Mbit/sec 
75666052 bytes written, speed = 72.16 Mbit/sec 
117306924 bytes written, speed = 74.58 Mbit/sec 

### Stream can be received by dvbsnoop for example:
